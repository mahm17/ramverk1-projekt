About us
=========================

This page is run by a couple of skiing enthusiasts that wanted a way to help new people coming in to the sport, or advanced riders that just want a place where they can chat and hang out with other like minded people. If you have any questions regarding the webpage just put up a forum post and we will make sure to answer any concerns you might have. Or if you just want to chat with us.

Me who created this page and monitors it is Markus Holmberg. I am studying Webbporgrammering at Blekings Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, and I have a very big interest in skiing in general but mostly slopestyle and offpist riding. So that's why I thought this would make a good project to work with because it is something that i very much enjoy to do.
